# 100 Days of Python

A collection of Python projects completed as part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge, focusing on building practical programming skills through hands-on projects.

## Projects

### Day 1: Band Name Generator
A simple interactive program that generates creative band names by combining user inputs.
- **Concepts**: Variables, string concatenation, f-strings, user input

### Day 2: Tip Calculator
Calculates the tip amount and splits the bill among friends.
- **Concepts**: Float arithmetic, type conversion, string formatting

### Day 3: Pizza Delivery System
An ordering system that calculates pizza prices based on size and toppings.
- **Concepts**: Conditional logic (if/elif/else), nested conditions

### Day 4: Multiple Mini-Projects
- **Rock Paper Scissors**: Classic game with random computer opponent
- **FizzBuzz**: The classic programming challenge
- **Password Generator**: Creates secure random passwords
- **Concepts**: Random module, loops, list comprehension, string methods

### Hangman
A fully-featured word guessing game with lives system.
- **Concepts**: File I/O, functions, while loops, enumerate, list manipulation

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.14**
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive development
- **External packages**: `art` (ASCII text art)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100-days-of-python.git
   cd 100-days-of-python
   ```

2. Open notebooks in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Run each notebook cell by cell to see the projects in action.
